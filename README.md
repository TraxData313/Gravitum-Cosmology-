# Space to Quantum Complexity equivalence principle
aka The Gravitum Theory

## Overview

This project explores a simple but powerful assumption:

> **Space = Quantum Complexity.**

Recent research has uncovered deep links between **quantum entanglement complexity** and the **structure of space**. While technical papers on this topic exist, accessible explanations for the general public are rare.

Here, we follow the consequences of that assumption step by step ‚Äî from calculating the information content of the universe to predicting its expansion rate ‚Äî and we compare those predictions with real cosmological data.

## Plan of Action

### 1. Count the Universe's Information Bits

* Imagine crushing the entire observable universe into a **black hole**.
* Count the **pixels** (Planck areas) on its event horizon.
* This gives the total number of bits of pure information in our universe.

### 2. Calculate Quantum Complexity Growth

* Use the **Second Law of Quantum Complexity** to see how the complexity of those bits evolves over time.
* **Spoiler:** it grows extremely fast!

### 3. Connect Complexity to Space

* Guided by the **Holographic Principle**:

  ```
  Growth of Quantum Complexity = Growth of Space
  ```

### 4. Predict the Hubble Expansion Rate

* From our growth model, predict the **Hubble constant**.
* Compare with the observed value ‚Äî within error bars, the match is exact.

### 5. Compare with Standard Cosmology

* Current mainstream model: **Inflation** + **Big Bang**.
* Our model gives:

  * Smooth, continuous early-universe expansion (no discontinuities at inflation).
  * Correct prediction for the current universe radius.
  * Future slowing of expansion, rather than eternal acceleration.

## Reproducing the Model

The key prediction for the universe radius (R) over time (t):

$$
R(t) = \left( \frac{3 \cdot (\text{Universe Growth} \cdot t)}{4 \pi} \right)^{1/3}
$$

Where:

* **Growth** = number of bits √ó (Planck volume / Planck time)
* **Number of bits** is derived from black hole thermodynamics.

## Results

**Predicted Hubble constant:**

```
Predicted:  2.29 √ó 10‚Åª¬π‚Å∏ (m/s)/m
Observed :  2.35 √ó 10‚Åª¬π‚Å∏ (m/s)/m ¬± error
```
