# Appendix:

 - Recently a deep connection between Quantum Entanglement Complexity 
   and the Structure of Space has become a very hot subject of study.
 - There are a lot of technical papers online regarding this subject,
   but there are little available to the general public, 
   on this new and exciting topic.
 - I decided to put toghether this short Jupyter note,
   where we'll just follow the consequences of a powerful assumption:
   "Space IS nothing but Quantum Complexity"

# Out plan of action:

 1. Count how many bits of information there are in our Universe:
  - Take the observed Universe and crush it into a Black Hole.
    In order to answer how much bits there are in out Universe,
    we will count the pixels on the Horizon of the resulting Blach Hole.

 2. Calculate the Quantum Complexity of our Universe' bits:
  - Using the Second Law of Quantum Complexity, we are going to
    calculate how the complexity of those bits evolves with time.
    SPOILER: It grows fast!

 3. After that we are going to take the hint from the Holographic
    principle (Space = Quantum Complexity), and are going to 
    assume that Growth of Quantum Complexity = Growth of Space

 4. Once here, we will have our model of the Universe expansion and put it to the test:
  - We are going to calculate the predicted Hubble expansion rate for our
    theory, and compare it with the real (observed) Hubble exp rate

 5. Now, let's plot our model agains the data from the standard expansion models:
  - Currently our Universe expansion is modeled by the Big Bang Theory, which
    can be traced back to almost time = 0 seconds.
  - Before that, Inflation theory predicts that the Universe expanded rapidly in a fraction
    of a second, just moments after time = 0 (at about t = 1e-35 seconds (0.0...35zeroshere..01 seconds))
  - There is no "standard" theory of what happened before Inflation.

  - Will our model be able to extend back to that "before Inflation" time?
  - Will our model show a smoother picture of what could have happened?
  - Can we go even further?

# Lets get started and see!

 What we you need to be able to follow this presentation?
 - Only some hight school maths and maybe basic Python knowedge
 - We are going to let Python do all the heavy leafting for us

Open Gravitum_onlineRead.ipynb or dowload and read the GravitumTheory.html. Its the same content.
